    "#Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that aims to create a hierarchy of clusters. It starts by considering each data point as an individual cluster and then iteratively merges the closest clusters until a single cluster containing all the data points is formed. It differs from other clustering techniques in that it creates a nested hierarchy of clusters rather than assigning each data point to a specific cluster."

Outliers are often represented as individual clusters that are far away from other clusters in the dendrogram.

Additionally, some distance-based outlier detection methods can be applied on the dissimilarity matrix or the cluster assignments derived from hierarchical clustering."
